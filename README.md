# Water Quality Prediction using Multiple ML Algorithms  ## Project Overview This project focuses on predicting water potability (whether it's safe for human consumption) using a dataset of physicochemical water quality parameters. To build a robust and well-performing model, we trained and evaluated seven different machine learning algorithms.
